# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Roberto Hernandez Jr**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://honorable-tough-brook.glitch.me/)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[Probably correct attributes order for the CSS, it didnt format correctly immediately.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The CSS does not work as the rest of the language for errors. Did not know where to place the tag and my colors were not working, but after messing with it I was able to figure it out. I took one course where the last project did use CSS, so I had an idea of the format. A lot of the coding was just reading trough instruction and understanding their function. Because I have taken some classes before most of it was straight forward and was just copying and pasting the right way for it to work. I have coded before but never used JavaScript, and CSS only once on a single assignment. I think if I had more time, I would probably spend most of my time in the CSS and JavaScript because it is the most unfamiliar thing to me. Once I understand fully the implementing the functions or libraries would be easy but that is usually what I think in the beginning, and then everything is always more complicated than initially thought.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Why is there is so much fragmentation to implement the webpage. I understand having different files to keep resources separated help keeping things organized or changes become easier, but there three different languages that do not follow the same rules, so it is a lot for a single person to implement. I get that simple pages are easy and that a company might have a team to manage more interactive ones, but it seems so inefficient to have so much fragmentation to make a webpage work. I get that protocols are different for data and backend for processing but to make a simple page that had all its resources in the browsers should not require so many languages.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would try to implement all the optional features, but I think a fun one would be phasing the tone gradually trough every cycle so that itâ€™s not just different to the default tone but that for every cycle the sound is not the same so it be a harder game.  Another challenge would be changing the location of each square each cycle, they would keep the same tone, but the position would change and as it proceeds shuffle more each time, with more squares like 6 it would be a lot more difficult.]
